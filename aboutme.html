<center><em>Your essay beautifully captures the joy and therapeutic benefits of cooking! It's clear that cooking is more than just a hobby for you - it's a way to express yourself, relax, and connect with others. The way you describe the sensory experiences of cooking, from the aromas to the sounds, is especially vivid and engaging.

What inspired you to start cooking, and has your experience with it changed over time</em></center>
